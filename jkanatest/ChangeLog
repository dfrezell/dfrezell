	- Changed Kana class to hold the hiragana, katakana, and romaji list for
	each element.  Instead of matching arrays, there is now an object for
	each character.  The characters are parsed from an XML file, which should
	make the program much more extensible...even able to flashcard test
	kanji.
	- The main class JKanaTest had to change to support an array of Kana
	objects.

    - Change name of "Romanji" back to "Romaji", I found out the latter is
    really correct.
    - Added a GraphicsUtil to find the center point offset for an app window,
    this was done do support various versions of java.
    - Add beginnings of stat tracking support.  Instead of using the weird array
    thing, a seperate class keeps track of the right and wrong answers.
    - Add reshuffling method to support repeating wrong answers.

    - Use my own font instead of trying to find a system font to load, this
    gives uniform look on all platforms
    - Change all Color.XXX to Color.xxx to support versions of Java less than
    1.4.x
    - Change name of "Romaji" to "Romanji" in the code and for text.
    - Update to the correct version:  0.0.5
    - Remove image support, since we use our own font.
    - Added progress bar to indicate how many characters left.
    - Start construction of Stats panel.

	- Changed the build script so that debug lines are in stack traces.
	- PrefManager checks for Java 1.4, if it doesn't find it then returns
	all default values.
	- Removing 1.4 dependencies in the main code, slow process, need to
	find a better way to test.

	Change the name of the Application to JKana Test.  I'm updating
	all the strings, so hopefully I find them all.
