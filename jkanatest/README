I recently, July 24 2003, started to learn Japanese.  I'm taking a night
course offered by a local college.  In order to facilitate learning Hiragana
and Katakana, I did a quick search on the internet and found this site:
<http://clay.ll.pl/kanatest.html>.  A simple, easy program to train with.
So, I downloaded, compiled and ran...everything was good.  The problem was,
supporting GTK+ apps under Windows and MacOS X is a pain in the ass.  I have
a Mac laptop, so my goal was to write a cross-platform program that does
the same thing.  Hence, we have Kana Test...I'm going to change the name
when I get around to it, maybe something clever like JKana Test.  Anyways,
It's in the same spirit as the original, even using the same images when
the user doesn't have Japanese fonts installed.  Well, the name is now
officially changed to...[drumroll]...JKana Test.

This program is released under the MIT license, which basically boils down
to:  Do whatever the hell you want with it, just mention me if you use it.

Let me know if you enjoy the program or if you find a bug.
