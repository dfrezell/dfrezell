I've been playing boardgames for a little while now, maybe 5 months or so
and I've been wanting to convert on of them to a computer version.  This is
one of my latest attempts and seems to finaly come to a level of playability.
There is still a ton of stuff to do, but if you've played Ricochet Robots before
it should be pretty easy to use this game.  I've tried to remain faithful to
the graphics of the game and even use the boards from the second edition.

This program is released under the MIT license, which basically boils down
to:  Do whatever the hell you want with it, just mention me if you use it.

Let me know if you enjoy the program or if you find a bug.
