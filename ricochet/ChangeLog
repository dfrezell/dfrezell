    - Set the name of the bid textfield so it can be identified by action
    listeners.
    - Add the GameState as an ActionListener to the bid text field.

    - Add generic param to the GameStatusEvent.  This will be used to pass the
    number of moves it took to complete a puzzle and such.
    - Use new stat panel graphic provided by Cory.
    - Created an ImageButton class, cause I keep forgetting the fields I need
    to set to make a button that is just an image.

    - Fix bug with being able to move in the opposite direction it came from.
    - Add one level of undo/redo, with the capability of doing multiple levels
    of undo/redo.
    - Moved the current target to the GameState, instead of the Board.  Keeping
    all game specific things in the State, not spread around.
    - Added a new GameStatusEvent: target picked.

    - Add preferences dialog, used to set black robot and catchup rule.
    - Moved the preferences strings to a class called Prefs.
    - Now use RandomLib for distributing the robots on the board.  Still need
    to change it so it doesn't loop when we get a bad square.

    - Add game checking to see if the person has reached their target.
    - Trying to cleanup some random code.
    - Added new GameStatusEvent codes, a target reached and target not reached.
    Currently only firing the target reached message.
    - Change Board so it listens to GameStatusEvents, this is how the reset
    is handled now.
    - Also changed Board so it listens to MoveEvents, this was done so we
    can be sure that the robots positions will be updated before checking
    if we reached the target.  This was causing a minor bug where you reset
    after hitting the target and the target hitting robot was moving back one
    space.  This happened since we updated the robots home positions before we
    had a chance to let the Board update the robots new position.
    - Rearranged code so that override public methods appear after private
    messages.  the overrides should appear at the bottom.
    - Added function to see if a robot is a valid target condition in Target.
    This is used to test for end of path conditions.
    - Add accelerator keys to the menu.

    - Add game stat panel to the top of the board.  This keeps tracks of the
    number of robot moves made.
    - Change the layout of the main window to be a BorderLayout to make it
    easy to add the StatPanel
    - Fix bug that caused the robot not to be able to move the opposite
    direction of the last move, even though the game was reset.  Basically
    I forgot to set the m_lastMove = null in the GameState.
    - Add GameStatus[Event/Listener], this will allow others to get notified
    of a game reset or new game condition.  We do this to allow the StatPanel
    to reset the count of robot moves.
    - Add a randomizeList function to the RandomLib.  This will allow us to
    shuffle our targets and various other things.
    - When user presses pick target button, display the target on the center
    tile.
    - Have the board keep track of all the targets in an array.  When we set
    what the current target is, we use an index in the target array.

	- Add the move history, basically a Vector that keeps all the moves, this
	will allow undo in future versions.  Currently their is no bounds placed
	on the history vector, it should be cleared after each successfule attempt
	in the later games.
	- Add check to prevent the robot from moving one direction and moving the
	opposite direction immediately, the robot can only move left or right after
	he has moved.
	- Cleanup the scaling code for the images, this is done in a central
	location with the other code calling the GraphicsUtils.
	- Added drawing the robot path, took a first swipe and there are some major
	issues.  Will need to think of a better approach.
	- Added reset to the game which restores the board to original position.

    - Dicked around with the randomize of the panels, spent way too much time
    just to fall back on the normal way.

	- Start of doing the Changelog and other notes.
